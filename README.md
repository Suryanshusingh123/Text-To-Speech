# Speak

## Summary

The base of this project is Android Text to Speech. While reading, I come across some heavy words that are hard to pronounce. Android 6.0 Marshmallow introduced a new floating text selection toolbar, which brings the standard text selection actions, like cut, copy, and paste, closer to the text youâ€™ve selected. Even better though is the new `ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT` which makes it possible for any app to add custom actions to that text selection toolbar.
